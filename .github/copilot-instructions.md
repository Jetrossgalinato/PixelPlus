# Copilot Instructions

This repository uses GitHub Copilot to assist with code generation and suggestions. Below are the instructions and guidelines for using Copilot effectively in this project.

## Project Overview

- PixelPlus is a Photoshop-like system for photo editing using OpenCV. The project is structured as a monorepo with separate frontend and backend directories.
- The frontend is built with Next.js, Electron, Tailwind CSS, and lucide-react.
- The backend is developed using FastAPI and OpenCV (Python).

## Monorepo Structure

- `frontend/` - Contains the Next.js and Electron application.
- `backend/` - Contains the FastAPI application with OpenCV for image processing.

## Activate always during prompting

- Ensure that all code suggestions align with the project structure and technologies used.
- Follow best practices for both frontend and backend development.
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend code.
- Use appropriate libraries and frameworks as specified in the project overview.
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Test code snippets to ensure they work as intended before finalizing.
- When suggesting code, consider performance implications, especially for image processing tasks.
- Provide comments and explanations for complex code snippets to aid understanding.
- Ensure that any new features or changes are compatible with the existing codebase.
- Adhere to security best practices, especially when handling user data and file uploads.
- Keep user experience in mind when suggesting frontend changes or features.
- Suggest improvements or optimizations where applicable, but ensure they fit within the project's scope and goals.
- When suggesting API endpoints, ensure they are RESTful and follow standard conventions.
- Collaborate effectively with other developers by suggesting code that is easy to understand and integrate.
- Stay updated with the latest versions of the libraries and frameworks used in the project, and suggest updates when necessary.
